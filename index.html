        <li><h3>Summary</h3></li>
        <p>With a background in Journalism and over 15 years of experience in photography, I have developed a keen eye for detail and storytelling. My career began with capturing moments and crafting narratives through the lens, which honed my skills in visual communication and media. Recently, I've expanded my expertise into the realm of coding. This transition is fueled by my growing interest in technology and my practical experience from enhancing my website and social media content over the years. By integrating coding into my skill set, I'm now able to bridge the gap between creative media and technical innovation, positioning myself at the intersection of journalism, visual artistry, and digital development.</p>
